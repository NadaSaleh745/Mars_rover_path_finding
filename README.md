# Mars_rover_path_finding
This project simulates Mars rover navigation across a terrain map, implementing and comparing several search algorithms from artificial intelligence for path planning. The goal is to move the rover from a starting location to target site while considering terrain, elevation, obstacles, and energy costs.
